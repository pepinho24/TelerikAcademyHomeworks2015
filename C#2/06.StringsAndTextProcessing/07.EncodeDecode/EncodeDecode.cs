/*Problem 7. Encode/decode

Write a program that encodes and decodes a string using given encryption key (cipher).
The key consists of a sequence of characters.
The encoding/decoding is done by performing XOR (exclusive or) operation over the first letter of the string with the first of the key, the second – with the second, etc. When the last key character is reached, the next is the first.
