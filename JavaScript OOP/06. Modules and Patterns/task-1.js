/* Task Description */
/* 
 * Create a module for a Telerik Academy course
 * The course has a title and presentations
 * Each presentation also has a title
 * There is a homework for each presentation
 * There is a set of students listed for the course
 * Each student has firstname, lastname and an ID
 * IDs must be unique integer numbers which are at least 1
 * Each student can submit a homework for each presentation in the course
 * Create method init
 * Accepts a string - course title
 * Accepts an array of strings - presentation titles
 * Throws if there is an invalid title
 * Titles do not start or end with spaces
 * Titles do not have consecutive spaces
 * Titles have at least one character
 * Throws if there are no presentations
 * Create method addStudent which lists a student for the course
 * Accepts a string in the format 'Firstname Lastname'
 * Throws if any of the names are not valid
 * Names start with an upper case letter
 * All other symbols in the name (if any) are lowercase letters
 * Generates a unique student ID and returns it
 * Create method getAllStudents that returns an array of students in the format:
 * {firstname: 'string', lastname: 'string', id: StudentID}
 * Create method submitHomework
 * Accepts studentID and homeworkID
 * homeworkID 1 is for the first presentation
 * homeworkID 2 is for the second one
 * ...
 * Throws if any of the IDs are invalid
 *
 * Create method pushExamResults
 * Accepts an array of items in the format {StudentID: ..., Score: ...}
 * StudentIDs which are not listed get 0 points
 * Throw if there is an invalid StudentID
 * Throw if same StudentID is given more than once ( he tried to cheat (: )
 * Throw if Score is not a number
 * Create method getTopStudents which returns an array of the top 10 performing students
 * Array must be sorted from best to worst
 * If there are less than 10, return them all
 * The final score that is used to calculate the top performing students is done as follows:
 * 75% of the exam result
 * 25% the submitted homework (count of submitted homeworks / count of all homeworks) for the course
