                        Fruits are a great-tasting way to get vitamins, minerals and fiber 
                        and to gratify your sweet tooth without loading up on calories. 
                        And except for a few, such as avocado, coconut and olives, fruits are virtually fat-free.
                        Fruits contain phytochemicals — a group of compounds that may condense your hazard of chronic diseases, 
                        such as heart disease, diabetes and some cancers.
